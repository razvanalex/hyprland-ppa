Description: A customizable and extensible shell
 This is a library built for GJS to allow defining GTK widgets in a declarative way. It also provides services and other utilities to interact with the system so that these widgets can have functionality. GJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Firefox's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine and the GNOME platform libraries, the same runtime GNOME Shell runs on.
